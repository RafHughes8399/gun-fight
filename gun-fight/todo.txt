sprint meter

increse bullet speed x 

-> item implementation
-> item spawning
-> obstacle distances
-> item interaction
-> item hud display

start with an easy one like the health pickup


basic logic, when the gunman collides with an item
the item is removed from the environment and added to player item slot

the item is displayed on the player's hud, upon using the item, the item is removed from the hud
and the effects are executed


the item update checks if the use key is pressed, if so then the item is used

might need to distinguish between items that affect the gunman and items that affect the environment


item spawning

item art:
general ammo pickup - bullets
health pickup - spaghetti
dynamite - dynamite stick
rifle - rifle bullet
revolver - revolver bullet
strawman - silhoutte


item has state
either in the inventory or on the ground, changes how update works

item spawning:

every 6 seconds an item is spawned on both sides of the screen,
use the parts of the screen that are not used for the obstacle spawning

-> gunman collides with item, add to inventory


-> check if the player collides with an item, if it does, add to the inventory

-> item update, draw and use

-> check the cactus 

item use needs the player and the entities not the gunman
-> draw the item in the hud, then use the item, 
-> limit extra health to 3

-> draw the strawmaan and the ammo 


-> make 






-> draw the item furhter down, more of a gap between it and the hearts x 


-> use isnt removing the item, double check the key  x
-> reduce the spawn rate x
-> reset the item and timer on round reset x
-> gunman needs an armour field and animation 
-> itme use, just do dynamic cast and check each isntance

-> max two lives not three

-> armour - max one
-> strawman
-> ammo

-> gave gunman armour
-> gunman reset and gunman animation change when gets armour, and gunman take damage 
-> created strawman class
-> changed how item.use handles paramters
-> implemented health, armour, ammo and strawman use


-> do i draw armour icons ???

TODO:

 -> fix obstacle
 -> make gun rifle pew pew


 -> max items on both sides
