TODO:


-> tumbleweed movemen, gets stuck on cacti easily 
-> rework level generation, its not working as it used to (fixed)

-> barrel redraw and animation (done)
-> bullet redraw (and firing animation?) (done)
-> hud and background redesign
-> wagon design and animation
-> gunman design and movement animation

-> menu navigation
-> new weapons and pickups



for dynamite:
- there is an x that shows where the dynamite lands
- holding the fire button increases the distance thrown, represetned by the x
- once landing the dynamite sits until the timer goes off, when it explodes, anything in the 
radius takes damage


-> refactor weapon to use animation
pass in the direction of the gunman, 
then in fire, make the bullet and return it, then add to entiteis in gvunman update

-> rethink how it works


-> refactor projectile, it should not need the weapon 
-> the weapon is merely a means of creating bullets


ok refactor weapon to be an entity that is the big next step
- for now has no texture, nor size but does have position
- spawns a bullet at  weapon + 5 * direction or s

- then the bullet is created after firing
simplify the background for now
do gunman textures for all the weapons
